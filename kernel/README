== Compiling native applications on Android ==

For more information about Android Kernel compiling/running, please check
documentation in our modified version of Android Kernel (Goldfish) 2.6.X.

This file describe a bit about compiling native applications on Android,
specially modules.

For compiling native applications, you always have to cross-compile the 
application to ARM, so that it can be run on any ARM-based system. See
this tutorial (http://www.bekatul.info/content/native-c-application-android) 
for more details about compiling Android C native applications.

= Compiling =

First, set your PATH variable to include the cross-compiler tools

# export PATH=<android_src_code>/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/

Than, compile the applications using the available Makefiles. In addition,
you have to set CROSS_COMPILE and ARCH variables

# CROSS_COMPILE=~/android_src/prebuilt/linux-x86/toolchain/arm-eabi-4.4.3/bin/arm-eabi- ARCH=arm make

= Running =
Copy the output to the emulator/device using adb and run it normally.
